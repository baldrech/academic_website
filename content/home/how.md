Step 1: collect available fish size data from diverse sources.

Step 2: Apply size-based theory and statistical analyses to estimate fish size distributions through space.

Step 3: Estimate expected distributions in unfished populations and document what we are missing and what we can change. 





<!---

**Step 1: Collect fish size data from diverse sources**
Here, we focus on coastal and freshwater fish, as these species are most readily encountered by people in our every-day lives, and often fall into ‘data-poor’ (limited information) fisheries. We will collect fish body size information from a vast array of sources - historical records, recreational anglers & divers, underwater surveys, local fish markets, artisanal fishers, and citizen science.  

**Step 2: Apply size-based theory and a range of statistical analyses**
We will build upon the existing and growing evidence we collect to estimate size distributions of fish species at specific locations and times. Next, we will assess how these observed size distributions differ from what would be expected under no fishing or climate change scenarios. We will apply these methods to as many species as possible, including those that are never harvested by humans, in densely populated and remote locations.  

**Step 3: document fish size distributions through space and time**
Fish size information can inform us about ecosystem functioning, whether fish sizes are changing, help clarify the role of fishing and climate change; and help us identify how we can sustain or promote a high abundance of large-bodied fish into the future.
