Are you interested? We need you! Please join our project. Even small contributions count.

1.	Help us collect data on fish sizes in your local area. Whether you are an angler, artisanal fisher, spearfishing enthusiast, diver, or like going to a local fish market, you can tell us what you see. Our app will be launching soon, so please [contact us](mailto:asta.audzijonyte@utas.edu.au) if you would like to test it in your local area.

We come in all shapes and sizes, **but with a common love of the oceans.**

This project is aimed at bringing together the everyday experiences of people at the fore-front of human-ocean interactions,

From recreational & artisanal fishing, 

strolling through fish markets,

snorkling & diving,

to scientists & stakeholders. 

**How you can partake**

**Get active: help us collect data on fish sizes in your local area.** 
Keep a log of the fish you encounter. Whether you're an angler, artisanal fisher, spearfisher, diver, or like going to a local fish market, record and share size fish you see. We've made this easy with our simple FishSizeProject app, from which you can upload photos (with size, location and time) online, or send them by email. Recording this information also helps you keep track of your catch, best fishing sites (which are private to you), trip dates and other details.

**Look back: photographic windows into the past**
Help us collect historical information on how big the fish could get. You can upload historic photos of fish to our app with information on location and time. As long as there is a human reference point in the photo (e.g. holding the fish), or a scale, we can use these photos to provide valuable historic data. Even if you don’t know the exact fish size in the photo, we will get our fish specialists onto the job and derive great value from this information. If you have other sources of historical information, please also get in touch!

**Become a fish detective**
If you have expertise in local fish identification, and can help us ensure the photos of fish we collect are correctly identified to help minimise errors in our data, and are keen to get on board, pease reach out to us.  

If you would like to help communicate the message, spread the word around, start a local project, contribute IT skills, contribute with beautiful drawings, write a popular science article, or help in other ways – we would love to hear it.
